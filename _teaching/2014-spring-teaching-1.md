Smart buildings and digital engineering in teaching

The Smart Buildings & Digital Engineering MSc is embedded in our teaching at the UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering. The world is changing at a faster and faster rate, and so are our buildings. Digital modelling tools and technological advances, like the Internet of Things, provide unparalleled insights and data on how our buildings are designed and operated. As such, we developed a programme that takes a forward-looking view on the impact of this digital transformation to the established discipline of Building Services Engineering.
